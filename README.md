WHOO! Doin' it!
the night is dark and full of terrors
the one ring to rule them all
Good is not kept in the balance by big things, it is the little things that keep the darkness at bay.
the cake is a lie
when you can't get down, find a haystack
This drink, I like it. ANOTHER!! *CRASH*
*Intense drumming music* ... *Intense drumming music restarts* ... *Intense drumming--* "GET ON WITH IT!!"
"Sire, I think I have a plan." *sounds of building* *cat screaches* --to be cont.--
